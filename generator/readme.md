fake word generator
===================

Uses markov chains (from [foswig.js](https://github.com/mrsharpoblunto/foswig.js/)) to generate random fake words.

Has three word lists, all from diceware dictionaries.

Additional criteria can be specified using a javascript field (variable is called `word`)
